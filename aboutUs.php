				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>For this project, our group the Website Warriors, aimed to introduce a more cohesive way to introduce
					learning Unix.
					Some of our main goals when breaking down the necessary information were to maintain a simple to
					navigate design, user-friendly interface, and overall functionality while still engaging the users
					interest.

			<div>
				<h4>No boredom allowed!</h4>
				<p>We do not want this UNIX tutorial guide to be boring in any way, or for the user to have a “... I
					really have to learn UNIX today” kind of feeling.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>User Interaction</h4>
				<p>We want the user to see our UNIX tutorial guide as an educational, and also a fun learning environment.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Design and Architecture</h4>
				<p>Our website will be a very user friendly site, that is easy to use and navigate. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Only for the Better</h4>
				<p>We want to build a website that is better structured and suited for our audience. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Drawing the User in</h4>
				<p>When creating content, we want to assume the user has no experience with UNIX.</p>
